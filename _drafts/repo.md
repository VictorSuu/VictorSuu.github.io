title: Laplace Approximation for Bayesian Deep Learning
abstract: Making a deep neural network Bayesian is a difficult task. For my Masters' thesis I've been using Laplace Approximation to achieve this and developed a plug & play PyTorch implementation I would like to showcase in this post. Let's dive in!
