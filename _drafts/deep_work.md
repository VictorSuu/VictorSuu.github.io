# {{ page.title }}

I’ve become interested in the way I work when I started programming. Before, the term _“flow”_ or the phrase _“getting lost in your work”_ didn’t mean much to me, but when I’m programming this is exactly what happens: I look up and several hours have passed. I’ve even adopted the habit of setting a timer to remind myself that I need to get up and move once in a while.

Unfortunately, this never happens to me with any other kind of work like reading or writing papers or solving math problems. The book I want to present here tries to convince you that it is almost always possible to work this way, regardless of the thing you are trying to do, and that it is both the most effective _and_ most fun way to go about it, which confirms a suspicion I had from the beginning.

Once you are on board, the [second part](#part-2-becoming-a-deep-worker) of the book tries to give you some tips and tools on how to achieve this (go ahead and skip [part one](#part-1-what-is-emdeep-workem-and-why-should-you-care) if you already have a good idea what Deep Work is and and are convinced that it makes sense but struggle to actually do it). If this sounds awfully American to you, rest assured, it is. In fact, the writing style and motivational reasons are the books weakest point in my opinion. Way too much focus lies on aspects like _excelling in your domain_, _getting ahead_ and _being successful_ while the to me much more convincing arguments like _having fun_ and _deriving meaning from your work_ are–while being mentioned–branded as _“lofty philosophical”_.

Anyway, the message being delivered is nonetheless interesting and worth sharing, which I’ll try to do in the upcoming paragraphs. This article is neither meant as a classic book review or summary, but rather as a highly condensed _“best of”_ and a reference for quickly looking up specifics you intend to incorporate into your own way of doing things.

## Part 1: What is _Deep Work_ and why should you care?

Before we can continue talking about _Deep Work_ we first need to know what it is. While I’m sure you have a pretty good idea what is meant by the term, here is the definition given in the book:

> **Deep Work:** Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

Here are some possible examples of deep work (possibly biased towards my own profession and interests):

* Computer programming
* Playing a musical instrument
* Writing a book or paper
* Producing something complicated with your own hands (e.g. pottery or carpentry)

Ok, let’s also have a quick look at the antonym, just to make sure:

> **Shallow Work:** Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

* Surfing the internet for information
* “_[…] [S]ending and receiving e-mail like a human network router[...]_”
* Formatting existing text and filling Excell tables

Here is the proposed shorthand to differentiate the two kinds of work in ambiguous cases. Simply ask yourself:

> How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate student with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?

If the answers is _“one or two”_ it most likely isn’t that deep of an activity (though those month might require a lot of deep work from the student to get there).

### Why you should care

I think deep work has always been important and most impressive things have been created by people practicing it. Be it great literature, music, art or inventions (though, especially in science, a fair amount of luck as well, which is regularly overlooked). The growing necessity of deep work is, however, new. This is of course due to the _“shift to an information economy”_ where _“more and more of our population are knowledge workers”_. Therefore, Newport proclaims deep work to be “_the superpower of the 21st century_”. Here is his hypothesis:

> **The Deep Work Hypothesis:** The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.

There are, as mentioned in the beginning, several paths of reasoning to come to this conclusion.

#### 1. Economic reasons

To thrive in the current and future information economy you need at least the following two core abilities which both depend on your ability to perform deep work:

* The ability to quickly master hard things. “_If you can’t learn, you can’t thrive_”.
* The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.

> **The Intellectual Life** by _Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges_: [Wo]Men of genius themselves were great only by bringing all their power to bear on the point on which they had decided to show their full measure.

You can formulate productivity as a scientific problem to then systematically solve it:
$$
\mathrm{High\ Quality\ Work\ Produced} = \mathrm{Time\ Spent} \times \mathrm{Intesity\ of\ Focus}
$$
As no one wants to waste time, your only other option to be more productive is to increase you intensity of focus. This, of course, is easier said than done. Interruptions are an especially fierce enemy of deep work, as it was found that your attention partly rests with the previous task when you switch, so you will never be able to “_bring all [your] power to bear on the point on which [you] had decided to show [your] full measure_”. So much for multi-tasking.

Only knowing this one fact allows you to critically observe many of your potential habits, like constantly checking you mail or social media, or your work setup, e.g. whether you work in an open office or not (which might create more opportunities for collaboration but do so at the cost of massive distraction). Another enemy of deep work:

> **The Principle of Least Resistance:** In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we fill tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.

In other words, if there are now incentives to work deeply, you will prefer shallow work. Here is one possible explanation for this behavior:

> **Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity:** In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.

#### 2. The idle mind is the devil’s workshop

With the boring stuff out of the way, let’s now look a more interesting reason to favor deep over shallow work: It’s simply more fun. If you are anything like me, you know the satisfaction from doing something manual, with your own two hands. Be it the renovation of an old piece of furniture, repairing your bike, building something or baking bread. Those activities seam inherently meaningful. Why is it then, you might ask, I rarely get this feeling from my professional work? As it turns out, it might be, that you are simply not equally immersed into those tasks.

> Our brains […] construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to. Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what your love–is the sum of what you focus on.

The task of a craftsman, and that’s you when doing something crafty, “_is not to generate meaning, but rather to cultivate in himself [or herself] the skill of discerning the meanings that are already there._” In other words, the meaning is already present in any demanding work, you just need to pay more attention at what you are doing instead of flicking back and forth between a million distracting whims. That can even be true for simple tasks though, as long as there is something to work towards.

> We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals.

Luckily, we can exploit one useful property: Jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time! This is because, as mentioned above, being in a state of flow, fully focusing on an interesting problem, is tremendously pleasing, and work is inherently flow-conducive as it features “_built-in goals, feedback rules and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed”_.

That’s certainly something I noticed when traveling alone through Canada after finishing my Bachelor’s degree, where each day I was entirely free to do whatever I liked. A state which quickly became quite burdensome, as all the responsibility of having a good day was entirely up to me and me alone. And of course I was expecting nothing less of myself than having the best time of my life. In the end I resolved this calamity by doing volunteer work, an activity that felt much more meaningful, and therefore more enjoyable, than traveling aimlessly from one town to the next.

## Part 2: Becoming a deep worker

> I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an email address. I’d used email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15 years of email is plenty for one lifetime. Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things. What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration.

You have diligently worked your way through the elevating prose or boldly skipped the first part of this article and are now eager to get something tangible? Either way, let’s cut to the chase: What follows are rules, tips and propositions to do better work and simultaneously have more fun doing so (click on the arrows to read more).

### Rule 1: Work deeply
<ul>
<li><details>
  <summary><strong>You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you   use it.</strong></summary>

You should therefore build yourself a daily routine to work by, which helps to spend less energy on organizing your work and more time on actually doing the work. This means you should schedule your deep work efforts. Consider using one of these options:

1. _The monastic philosophy of deep work scheduling:_ If your work is defined by one primary discrete goal and your success depends on doing this one thing exceptionally well–like writing books or articles if you are a writer–this might be for you.

     The idea is as radical as it is simple: While you work, eliminate _all_ influences that could interfere with your goal to get as much uninterrupted time as possible. This could mean going completely of the grid and even hiding from the world by going to a remote location–e.g. a small house on a Scottish island–for the time you need to complete you next project.

     > If I organize my life in such a way that I get lots of long, consecutive, uninterrupted time-chunks, I can write novels. But as those chunks get separated and fragmented, my productivity as a novelist drops spectacularly.

2. _The bimodal philosophy of deep work scheduling:_ If your work consists of tasks which require high levels of concentration for long consecutive time chunks but at the same time high degrees of interaction with world you might consider scheduling your deep work in this way. Among those employing this strategy might be academics, who need to write papers which push the boundary of what is currently known but at the same time have to collaborate with other researchers, attend conferences or give classes.

     To do so, divide your time into stretches of uninterrupted deep work and leave the rest of your time open for everything else. This could mean that, for some days, you refrain from checking your email or other media, retreat to a quiet place to work and concentrate on your complicated tasks until you are satisfied, then reemerge. This division of time can happen on multiple scales such that you dedicate four days a week or one week a month, or one season of a year to your deep work. It should be compatible with a large proportion of knowledge worker jobs but might require some adjustments in coworker expectations and clear communication.

3. _The rhythmic philosophy of deep work scheduling:_ If you can’t even disconnect for one or two days (and remember, we are only talking about your work life here), this might be the way to go. The only thing asked from you here is consistency. Dedicate a certain proportion of your day to deep work and then stick to it. _Every day_. The idea is that your form a habit of working deeply such that you don’t need to think about setting it up. You could probably also use this strategy as an entry level effort to work deeply and see where it gets you as it is also likely the most straight forward method of incorporating deep work into your normal schedule.

     It the philosophy I’ve chosen for my own work. I’ll stay disconnected in the morning, focus on complicated work till lunch and only then go online to check my email and indulge in other shallow activities.

4. _The journalistic philosophy of deep work scheduling:_ Finally, if you can’t actually schedule your deep work reliably in any other way, just switch into deep work mode immediately whenever an opportunity pops up! This comes with a big caveat though: “_just switch into deep work mode immediately_” is just not an option for most people. As discussed [earlier](#1-economic-reasons), efficiently switching between tasks is neurologically problematic and will deplete your finite willpower reserve. If possible at all, it requires a lot of training, so this strategy is definitely not recommended for the deep work novice. If you want to give it a try, at least try to think about possible deep work windows in advance on e.g. a weekly basis.

<summary><strong>Don’t work from inspiration.</strong></summary>

> There is a popular notion that artists work from inspiration--that there is some strike or bolt or bubbling up of creative mojo from who knows where... but I hope [my work] makes clear that waiting for inspiration to strike is a terrible, terrible plan. In fact, perhaps the single best piece of advice I can offer to anyone trying to do creative work is to ignore inspiration.

As it turns out, most important thinkers and great minds didn't wait for inspiration to strike but instead employed rituals designed to actively encourage their brains to be productive.

The argument is in the same vain as used above: ritualizing, i.e. forming a habit, helps to minimize the friction in the transition to depth. There is not one correct deep work ritual, but some general points should nonetheless be addressed:

1. **Where you'll work and for how long:** We did already discuss the _when_ above: Regardless of where you work, set yourself a specific time frame to keep the session a discrete challenge and not an open ended slog. The _where_ should be a quiet, tiedy place; even better if used exclusively for deep work.
2. **How you'll work once you start:** Give yourself rules extending the basic deep work definition. This might be a ban of internet use or a metric like words produced per twenty minutes. Without clear rules and goals you'll waste energy and willpower on thinking about how to work while you work.
3. **How you'll support your work:** How well you can focus doesn't only depend on your environemnt, but also on other factors like how you feel. You might want to have a ritual to settel into your deep work like a good cup of coffe before you start or some meditation, yoga or exercise. This might also include organizing the raw materials, like paper and pen, before starting.

Finding your personal deep work habit might take some time and experimentation, but is definitely worth it, because you more you use it, the more it will rewire your brain such that simply following your ritual brings you into a state of intense concentration.

<li><details>
<summary><strong>Make grand gestures.</strong></summary>
By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task. This boost in importance reduces your mind's instinct to procrastinate and delivers an injection of motivation and energy.

This somehow mimics the effect an external deadline or exam date has on most people, but, because it is created by you artificially, can be utilized whenever you need it.
</li></details>

<li><details>
<summary><strong>Don’t work alone.</strong></summary>
While the relationship between deep work and collaboration is tricky, it is often still worth trying to work out a problem with a partner. If you’ve ever discussed various approaches to a problem in front of a black or white board in preparation of a tough exam you know what this is about.

The key for this to work is often the ability to work deeply on the problem on your own first and _then_ discuss it with someone else. This is also why open offices often degrade productivity but the ability to meet people _in between_ work, e.g. during a coffee or lunch break, is extremely helpful.

<summary><strong>Execute like a business.</strong></summary>

> You are such a naive academic. I asked you _how_ to do it, and you told me _what_ I should do. _I know what I need to do. I just don’t know how to do it._

The division between _what_ and _how_ is crucial but is often overlooked. It’s often much easier to identify a strategy for achieving a goal than figuring out how to actually execute it once identified.

Say you want to become a great climber. Well, that’s easy! Just go climbing a lot and do lots of training. The difficult part is how to incorporate this into your life so that you have the time and motivation to pull through with it.

Enter _The 4 Disciplines of Execution_ come into play:
1. **Focus on the wildly important:** The more you try to do at once, the less you will accomplish. You should therefore concentrate only on the wildly important goals. In our case this is to work deeply. But because the general credo to spend more time working deeply doesn’t spark a lot of enthusiasm, you are better of setting yourself a specific, tangible goal like publishing five high-quality peer-reviewed papers in one year if you’re an academic.

   > If you want to win the war for attention, don’t try to say ‘no’ to the trivial distractions you find on the information smorgasbord; try to say ‘yes’ to the subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd out everything else.

2. **Act on the lead measures:** Okay, so you have identified your wildly important goal, but now you need to measure your success. There are two ways to look at this. (1) Have I achieved my goal? (2) Am I on the right track to achieving my goal i.e. is my environment and behavior conducive to making progress towards my goal?

   Is one of these angles superior? It turns out, it is. We might call the first approach the _goal_ measure and the second one the _process_ measure (they are sometimes also called _lag_ and _lead_ measure). The problem with the first approach is, that the feedback comes too late to change your behavior. Once the year is over and you look at your performance, it is already too late to change anything. The goal measure lacks impact on your day-to-day behavior.

   The second approach measures your success indirectly, but constantly, so you can tweak your behavior if needed. A good example for the process measure might be the time you spend each day working deeply. The more it is, the more you probably get done in a day, which has an indirect positive effect on you actual goal.

3. **Keep a compelling scoreboard:** I think of this discipline as a way of _gameification_. You set up some visual way of recording your achievements such that it is immediately visible how well you’re doing and that it would feel terrible to destroy your two weeks run of daily deep work or that you feel compelled to keep increasing this deep work counter.

4. **Create a cadence of accountability:** Keep yourself accountable. Plan your day (and if possible week) ahead of time and record your progress. At the end of the day (or week), review your work, celebrating when you did well ([I’m proud of you, son.]()) and analyzing what went wrong so you can adapt your plan for the next day(s).

### Rule 2: Embrace boredom

* **Schedule your use of the internet**
* **Give yourself deadlines**
* **Productive meditation**
  * **Be wary of distractions and looping**
  * **Structure your deep thinking**
* **Memorize a shuffled deck of cards**

### Rule 3: Quit social media

> **The Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection:** You’re justified in using a network tool if you can identify any possible benefit to its use, or anything you might possibly miss out on if you don’t use it.

> **The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection:** Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.

* **Identify the main high-level goals in both your professional and personal life**
* **The Law of the Vital Few**
* **Getting rid of unnecessary things**

### Rule 4: Drain the shallows

* **Account for every minute of your workday**
* **What percentage of my time should be spent on shallow work?**
* **Fixed-schedule productivity**
  * _Tip 1: Make people who send you email do more work_
  * _Tip 2: Do more work when you send or reply to emails_
  * _Tip 3: Don’t respond_
* **It’s the sender’s responsibility to convince the receiver that a reply is worthwhile**
* **Email filter**

> There’s also an uneasiness that surrounds any effort to produce the best things you’re capable of producing, as this forces you to confront the possibility that your best is not (yet) that good.
