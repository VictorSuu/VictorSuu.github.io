title: Deep Learning on photorealistic synthetic data
abstract: If you work in machine learning, or worse, deep learning, you have probably encountered the problem of too few data at least once. For a classification task you might get away with hand-labeling a couple of thousand images and even detection might still be within manual reach if you can convince enough friends to help you. And then you also want to do segmenation. Even if possible, hand-labeling is an incredibly boring, menial task. But what if you could automate it by rendering photorealistic synthetic training data with pixel-perfect annotations for all kinds of scene understanding problems?

  <figcaption style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em;"><b>Instance Segmentation:</b> Every <em>pixel</em> of every <em>instance</em> of each object, e.g. <em>couch</em> or <em>chair</em>, needs to be labeled in every image. The resulting <em>instance segmentation masks</em> can be visualized as semi-transparent overlays (hover over the image to see them). This insane amount of work leads to imperfect results: Only a subset of all visible objects gets labeled, not all instances get labeled (one of the two vases in the bookshelf is missing) or are lumped together (lower rows of books in the shelf), masks are not pixel-perfect (the light blue mask of the arm-chair) and objects get wrong labels (the fireplace is labeled as tv, the armchair in front is also labeled as couch).</figcaption>

I made this cup model you see above in an afternoon (so there is still some work involved) but I'm a complete novice to 3D modeling[^2] and an expert could probably make such a simple model in a few minutes. More complex objects might take more time, but there are already a lot of great 3D models out there you can download for free and even if you start from scratch, you only need to do it once and can reuse it for all kinds of projects and learning tasks.
