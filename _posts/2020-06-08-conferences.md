title: Important Conferences
abstract: I'm still exploring what it means to be a researcher. Here I'll take a look at conferences, which play an important role in my field. I'll also provide a timeline of the most important MACHINE/DEEP LEARNING, ROBOTICS, COMPUTER VISION and ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE conferences including paper submission deadlines. Work in progress!

# {{ page.title }}

Now that I’m a PhD candidate, I need to do real research. Come to think of it, it’s really quite amazing that one can make a living by exploring reality in my opinion. I also need to publish my research so it can get peer-reviewed and added to the great knowledge pool of humanity.

In machine learning and robotics, contrary to the long-established sciences like physics and biology, the most prestigious place to publish your research are conferences (or rather conference proceedings[^2]) rather than journals like _Nature_ and _Science_. In this article, I want to take a look at the most important of those conferences[^1], both as a reference and to learn more about this new world I’m currently discovering. But first, let’s have a look at what a (academic) conference even is:

> An academic conference or scientific conference (also: symposium, workshop, meeting, etc.) is an event for researchers (not necessarily academics) to present and discuss their work. Together with academic or scientific journals and Eprint archives such as arXiv, conferences provide an important channel for exchange of information between researchers. – Wikipedia

Most conferences consist of a number of presentations, highlighting the key insights from a previously submitted and accepted paper, followed by discussions. There can also be so called _keynote speakers_ who establish the underlying theme of the conference. Further, workshops can be part of a conference, allowing for a more hands on approach to the presented topic. They have their own format for paper submission, often with a lower barrier for acceptance. Conferences featuring both talks and workshops are called _double-track_.

## Conference Timeline[^3]
[^3]: Almost all conferences taking place in 2020 will be virtual conferences due to Covid-19.

### May 31-August 31: ICRA
#### Paper submission deadline: September 15<div class="date">Acceptance rate: 42.1%</div>

The _International Conference on Robotics and Automation_ is the worlds largest robotics research conference together with [IROS](#october-25-29-iros). Held annually, in 2020 it will take place in Paris (France) from May 31 to August 31.

Next to robotics it also covers advances in the fields of automation and artificial intelligence.

First held in 1984 in Atlanta (USA) it since took place in Japan, Belgium, China, France, Korea, Spain, Italy, Germany, Sweden, Australia, Singapore and Canada.

### June 14-19: CVPR
#### Paper submission deadline: November 15<div class="date">Acceptance rate: 27.5%[^7]</div>
[^7]: Average 2010 - 2019

The _Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition_ is the primary conference in its field. It is held annually, taking place in Seattle from June 14th to 19th in 2020.

_"CVPR is the premier annual computer vision event comprising the main conference and several co-located workshops and short courses."_ It features content from a wide range of topics related to computer vision and pattern recognition and consists of the main conference with talks and presentations as well as tutorials and workshops.

It was first held in Washington (USA) in 1983 and since then has rotated around the U.S.

### July 12-18: ICML
#### Paper submission deadline: February 5<div class="date">Acceptance rate: 29.1%</div>

The _International Conference on Machine Learning_ competes together with [NeurIPS](#december-5-12-neurips-aka-nips) for the first place of all conferences on machine learning. In 2020 it is held in Vienna (Austria) from July 12th to 18th in its 37th incarnation.

It touts itself as _“[…] the premier gathering of professionals dedicated to the advancement of the branch of artificial intelligence known as machine learning.”_ and features on aspects all around machine learning like _“artificial intelligence, statistics and data science, as well as important application areas such as machine vision, computational biology, speech recognition, and robotics.”_

It was first held in 1980 in Pittsburgh (USA) and then moved to Germany, France, Sweden, Austria, China, Israel, Canada, Australia, Scotland and Finland.

### August 23-28: ECCV
#### Paper submission deadline: March 5<div class="date">Acceptance rate: 28.3%[^5]</div>

[^5]: Average 2010 - 2018

The _European Conference on Computer Vision_ is the European counterpart to the [ICCV](#october-27---november-2-iccv) and is held in those years where ICCV is not. In 2020 it takes place in Glasgow (Scotland) from August 23rd to 28th in its 16th incarnation.

Like [CVPR](#june-14-19-cvpr) and ICCV, it is a double-track conference with talks, presentations, tutorials and workshops. Topics of interest include all aspects of computer vision and pattern recognition.

It was first held in France in 1990 and then moved to Italy, Sweden, the UK, Germany, Ireland, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Austria and Scotland.

### August 29 - September 5: ECAI
#### Paper submission deadline: November 19<div class="date">Acceptance rate: 26.3%[^5]</div>

[^5]: Average 2000 - 2018

The _European Conference on Artificial Intelligence_ is the leading conference on artificial intelligence in Europe and mentioned in the same breath with [IJCAI](#coming-soon) and [AAAI](#coming-soon) as one of three major conferences on general AI in the world. It is held annually and takes place in Santiago de Compostella (Spain) in 2020 in its 24th incarnation from August 29th to September 5th.

> Under the motto “Paving the way towards Human-Centric AI” *ECAI* provides an opportunity for researchers to present and discuss about the best AI research, developments, applications and results.

It is a double-track conference featuring talks, presentations, workshops and tutorials.

First held in 1974 in Brighton (UK) it subsequently moved through all of Europe including Germany, France, Italy, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, Hungary, Spain, Greece, Portugal and the Czech Republic.

### October 25-29: IROS
#### Paper submission deadline: March 1<div class="date">Acceptance rate: 45.6%</div>

The _International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems_, similarly to [ICML](#july-12-18-icml) and [NeurIPS](#december-5-12-neurips-aka-nips) in machine learning, competes with [ICRA](#may-31-august-31-icra) for the distinction of _"most prestigious conference in its field"_ . It is held annually and with its 2020 incarnation taking place in Las Vegas (USA) from October 25th to 29th.

It _"provides an international forum for world-wide robotics community to explore the frontier of science and technology in intelligent robots and smart machines"_.

It was first held in 1988 in Tokyo (Japan), then moved to the USA, Germany, France, Canada, Korea, Switzerland, China, Taiwan, Portugal and Spain.

### December 5-12: NeurIPS (aka NIPS)
#### Paper submission deadline: June 5<div class="date">Acceptance rate: 24.8%</div>

The _Neural Information Processing Systems_ conference is one of the most, if not _the_ most prestigious conference for machine learning. This year (2020) it comes in its 34th incarnation and will take place in December 5th through 12th at the Vancouver Convention Center.

It was first proposed in 1986 by _The California Institute of Technology_ and the infamous _Bell Laboratories_ and was an invitation only event. It was introduced as an interdisciplinary approach to biological and artificial neural networks though nowadays the latter is certainly much more prominent with a strong focus on machine learning, artificial intelligence and statistics.

Born in Snowbird, Utah (USA) it has since been held in Denver (USA), Vancouver (Canada), Granada (Spain), Lake Tahoe (USA), Montreal (Canada), Barcelona (Spain) and Long Beach (USA).
